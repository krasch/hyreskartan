<h1>Hyreskartan - about the data</h1>

Last updated: 2021-04-16

<h2>1. Map base - boundaries of the stadsdelar/districts</h2>
<p>
    Generated by myself based on a dataset released on the
    <a href="https://dataportalen.stockholm.se/dataportalen/">Stockholm data portal</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I have released the resulting geojson files into public domain (CC0) at
    <a href="https://github.com/krasch/stockholm-stadsdelar">https://github.com/krasch/stockholm-stadsdelar</a>.
    That repository also contains additional documentation about the geodata.
</p>

<h2>2. Kötider / waiting times</h2>

<p>All the data displayed on the map comes from the <a
        href="https://bostad.stockholm.se/statistik/hyra-och-kotid-per-omrade/">statistics
    page</a> of <a href="https://bostad.stockholm.se/">Stockholms Bostadsförmedling</a>.</p>

<p>The statistics page also allows you to filter apartments based on different criteria:</p>

<img src="statistiktjansten.png" alt="Screenshot of Stockholms Bostadsförmedling statistiktjänst"/>

<p>
    You might observe that the waiting times and number of apartments shown by hyreskartan slightly differ from the ones
    shown on the official site. This is due to small differences in the aggregation of the data, which are detailed
    below.
</p>


<h4>Antal rum / number of rooms</h4>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">Affected apartments</th>
        <td class="apartment-row">
            154 apartments with 1.5 rooms <br/>

            with 1.5 or 2.5 rooms are not included. Same for all the other room sizes. <br/>
            The only way to see apartments with e.g. 1.5 rooms is to select "Antal rum=Alla".
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <th>Hyreskartan</th>
        <td>The number of rooms is rounded down, i.e. 1.5 room apartments are grouped together with 1
            room apartments, etc.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">Affected apartments</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Official site</th>

    </tr>

    <tr>
        <th>Hyreskartan</th>
        <td>These apartments are grouped with "Vanlig hyresrätt" (which is, to be honest, a bit of a stretch
            for the "Kollektivhus" ones..)
        </td>

<h4>Nyproduktion / new builds</h4>

<table>
    <tr>

        <td>These apartments either don't show up when selecting "Endast nyproduktion", despite them being tagged as
            "nyproduktion" in the full apartment ad (annonsen). Or they don't show up when selecting "Utan nyproduktion",
            despite them not being tagged as "nyproduktion" in the apartment ad. In the latter case,
            these apartments are often tagged as "nyrenoverade"
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <th>Hyreskartan</th>
        <td>"Nyproduktion" / "Not nyproduktion" for these apartments is based on the tags in the apartment ad.
            "nyrenoverade" is grouped with "Not nyproduktion".
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


<h4>Kötider / waiting times</h4>

Since the data is from 2020, the waiting time selected by the user is subtracted by 1 (at the time of writing it is
2021).

<table>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">Affected apartments</th>
        <td class="apartment-row">
            All
        </td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Official site</th>
        <td>The waiting times are given as two-year wide intervals, e.g. if you have waited 3.5 years, you would
            fall into the [2-4] years interval. Apartments with 20+ years waiting times are combined
            into a ">20" group.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <th>Hyreskartan</th>
        <td>The waiting times are rounded up to the nearest year. Apartments with 20+ years are not grouped together.
            <br/>
            (Reason for rounding up: being conservative when showing results on the map. If the person who
            got the apartment waited 4.2 years, you should only see the apartment when you pick a waiting time >= 5 years)

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
